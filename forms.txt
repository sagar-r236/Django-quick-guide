Forms
------------------
Django 'Form' class is used to specify the fields in the form, their layout, display widgets, initial values,

Delaring a form
-----------------
The declaration syntax for a form is simialar to declaring a Model.

from django import forms


class StudentInfoForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField(help_text="Enter your name")


after you create a class what you have to do is create a object of form class which you have created and then pass
it to the context variable then the form will be retrived!
